# awesome-self-supervised
A collection of interesting papers and code for self-supervised learning(focused on images at the moment)

There is a lot of image/video data out there, how many humans can actually look at this. Having dabbled with supervised, semi, weak, unsupervised and active learning, it is still not straightforward. This is a collection of relevant code and papers if you are going through the same journey and evolution:
